1). Difference between abstract class and interface:

         Abstract class and interface are the type of abstraction.Abtract keyword is used for abstract class and interface keyword is used for interface
class.In both the class ,objects can't be created.In abstract class both abstract method and non abstract method can be used,but in interface we can only 
declare a method.Multiple interface can be acheived by interface but not in abstract class.

2). Constructor and object:

Constructor: A constructor is like an instance method that has the same name as the class, and can be used to set the values of the members of an object.
             Whenever an object is created, the constructor is called automatically.

Object     : Object is an instance of the class.Object allocates memory space whenever they are created.
       
3). Virtual and override:

Virtual : A virtual keyword is used to specify the virtual method in the base class.

Override: Override keyword is used to indicate that a derived class function is overriding a function with the same parameters and same name in the
          base class.

4). Abstract class cannot be sealed:

         The purpose of an abstract class is to provide a common interface and implementation for its derived classes.sealed keyword is used to prevent
 a class from being inherited.

5).Code:

using System;
public class Celsius
{
    double celsius = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());
    public void Kelvin()
    {
         double kelvin;
         kelvin = celsius + 273;
         Console.WriteLine("kelvin:{0}",kelvin);
    }
    public void Fahrenheit()
    {
        double fahrenheit= celsius*18/10+32;
         Console.WriteLine("Fahrenheit:{0}",fahrenheit);
    }
}
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Enter the degree celsius value:");
        Celsius obj=new Celsius();
        obj.Kelvin();
        obj.Fahrenheit();
    }
}
